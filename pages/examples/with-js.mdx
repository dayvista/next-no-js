import { BrowserComponent } from "../../modfed/BrowserComponent";

## The initial HTML for this page was rendered at build time - so it works without JavaScript + (really, try it)

But, when a page like this contains a Component marked as JS-ENABLED, the 2kb runtime loads, and then
loads any micro-bundles required for the component (in this example, that's Preact/compat)

Thanks to Module Federation, if multiple components on the same page share dependencies (eg: Preact)
they will 'share' them intelligently

### The timer below was server-side rendered

Once the page is ready, a tiny bundle loads and hydrates the markup

<DemoBlock>
    <BrowserComponent>
        <Counter />
    </BrowserComponent>
</DemoBlock>

export const config = {
    unstable_runtimeJS: false,
};

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
