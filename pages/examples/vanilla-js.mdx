## The initial HTML for this page was rendered at build time with regular React Components

### None of this page's markup with incur any 'hydration' costs at all.

But if any Component is marked as 'vanilla-js', then the 2kb runtime will load on demand, which
means you can use a regular JS script that allows you to interact with the DOM that was originally
created on the server.

Just think of how many times you wanted a small interaction to be handled with plain JS, but still
wanted the React Component model for generating the HTML...

Possibly the best part though, the component used for this 'counter' is the exact same one used in
the [Preact example](/examples/with-data).

### The timer below was server-side rendered

Once the page is ready, a tiny bundle loads and executes, re-using the DOM

<DemoBlock>
    <BrowserComponent kind={"vanilla"}>
        <Counter />
    </BrowserComponent>
</DemoBlock>

export const config = {
    unstable_runtimeJS: false,
};

export const meta = {
    title: "Next-no-js, on-demand Vanilla JS",
};

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
