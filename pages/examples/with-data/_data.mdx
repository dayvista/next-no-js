## This page uses the regular `getStaticProps` from NextJS to get some image data

You then write the Gallery feature as a regular idiomatic React component - using click handlers, accessing data,
adding CSS etc

But then when the page loads in the browser, the runtime will notice that there's a component to hydrate and it will
load in Preact along with <strong>just enough</strong> data to re-hydrate this component alone - NOT the entire
page. Seriously, go and view:source to see what I mean :)

## But how does it look in code?

The default with this approach is that EVERYTHING is static/inert by default.
That means the following code will server-render the HTML for all elements (h1, h2 etc) AND the gallery...

```typescript jsx
function App(props) {
    return (
        <main>
            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <h2>Please view our gallery</h2>
            <Gallery images={props.images} />
        </main>
    );
}
```

...but ZERO JavaScript would be loaded onto this page, meaning NO hydration costs. This can really make a difference
when you begin to have large pages with hundreds/thousands of DOM nodes

If you <em>do</em> want this to be controlled though, simply wrap it in a `BrowserComponent`

```typescript jsx
function App(props) {
    return (
        <main>
            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <h2>Please view our gallery</h2>
            <BrowserComponent>
                <Gallery images={props.images} />
            </BrowserComponent>
        </main>
    );
}
```
