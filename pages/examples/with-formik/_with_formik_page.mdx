import { Layout } from "~/ui/Layout";

## Get the full Next.js development experience, utilising the React eco-system.

This form _will_ work with or without JavaScript.

It's here to show an example of
how we can progressively enhance the experience of this page, without having the overhead
of React controlling every DOM node on the page.

### Example

```


export const meta = {
    title: "With Formik",
};

export const config = {
    unstable_runtimeJS: false,
};

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
```
