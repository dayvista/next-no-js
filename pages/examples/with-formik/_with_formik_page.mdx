import { Layout } from "~/ui/Layout";

## Get the full Next.js development experience + utilise the entire React eco-system.

This is another example of how we can progressively enhance the experience of
a component, without having the overhead of React controlling every DOM node on the page.

The form below was built with [Formik](https://formik.org/) and it will work with or _without_ JavaScript.

## Try it with JavaScript

Try using `dup@example.com` to see validation occurring
on the server - which is then displayed to the user without incurring a page reload.

## Try it without JavaScript

Or disable Javacript in your browser to see this form's validation working without
a single byte of JS.

## Why is this interesting?

Because now we're getting the benefit of a feature-rich form library + the component
model from React, but without the costs incurred when React has to control the entire page.

export const meta = {
    title: "With Formik",
};

export const config = {
    unstable_runtimeJS: true,
};

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
